# web-scraping-challenge
UofD Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 11 Challenge

The primary files are: part_1_mars_news.ipynb, part_2_mars_weather.ipynb, and mars_data.csv. Also included are: martian_temps.png, martian_sorted_temps.png, martian_pressure.png, and martian_year.png. All are located in the directory labeled (MarsNeedsScraping).

I used the format provided by the Starter-Code files provided.

The wikipedia entry for Mars (at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars) was used to verify the length of a Martian year.
